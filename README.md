This application is intended to demonstrate an SQL injection vulnerability.

It's a simple web service returning a count of all films containing a given string via GET.

As database the great [Sakila Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) is used. So you need a running mysql database. As connection url `jdbc:mysql://localhost/sakila` is used.
